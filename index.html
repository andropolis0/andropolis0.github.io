								<h2>Introduction</h2>

								<p>
									I got the idea for a Command Line Interface (CLI) Tic Tac Toe game in late 2023. I finally decided to start working on it after about a month. 
									The game itself is made entirely in C++, because that was the only programming language I knew at the time. Because I was just a beginner 
									programmer then, there may still be some bugs in it, but from my testing I haven't found any. 
								</p>
								<p>
									When I started making it I immediatly had to make a decision - are it's screens going to be animated or not. I came to the conclusion that it 
									might as well have them animated, since it's source code would mostly be logic otherwise. Now, the game does feel more lively, but that came at 
									the cost of hours of struggling and eventually me losing motivation and stopping progress for a bit. But after some time I finally got back to 
									it and finished it.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now that we got the "origins" out of the way, we can start talking about the actual gameplay. Upon starting the program you immediatly get a 
									little animation to show the first screen. On it you can choose either START or GUIDE.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div id="content-entry">
								<h2>Guide</h2>

								<p>
									If you pick guide, an animation will be played that neatly hides the first screen. Then you will be taken to the first page of the guide that 
									introduces you to the controls of the game, those being the controls that you use to move around the UI, although I did forget to add one more 
									control, and that is the R key. 
								</p>
								<p>
									When playing the actual game you can enter the letter R which will make the game close and take you to the previous screen. I actually probably 
									didn't forget to include it, but rather, there is no more space to even put it in. Ok, now back to the guide. If you decide to choose the >> in 
									the top right corner you will be taken to the second page, which explains the positions in the actual game. I could have gone with just numbering 
									the spaces 1-9 but I think that way it looks more fun.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now to exit the guide you select the << arrows, then when you are on the first page, you just select Return.
								</p>
							</div>

							<div id="content-entry">
								<h2>Start</h2>

								<p>
									If you select the START option on the first screen, you will be taken to the Gamemodes screen. There, as the name already implies, you can pick which 
									of the two gamemodes you want to play. Either PVP (Player VS Player) or PVC (Player VS Computer). That's... all there is to it. Moving on.
