								<h2>Introduction</h2>

								<img style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; float: right; width: 232px; height: 158px; border-radius: 5px;" src="/content/CMD-Tic-Tac-Toe/screen1.png">
								
								<p>
									I got the idea for a Command Line Interface (CLI) Tic Tac Toe game in late 2023. I finally decided to start working on it after about a month. 
									The game itself is made entirely in C++, because that was the only programming language I knew at the time. Because I was just a beginner 
									programmer then, there may still be some bugs in it, but from my testing I haven't found any.
								</p>
								<p>
									When I started making it I immediatly had to make a decision - are it's screens going to be animated or not. I finally decided that it 
									might as well have them animated, since it's source code would mostly be logic otherwise. Because of them, the game does feel more lively, 
									but that came at the cost of hours of struggling and eventually me losing motivation and stopping progress for a few weeks. But after some time 
									I finally got back to it and finished it.
								</p>
								<p>
									Now, the actual game. The first screen you'll see is the main menu (duh) and on it I've added a button that takes you to the guide, cuz... why not? 
									The guide briefly explains how to move around the UI and how to choose what place you want in the grid of the actual game.

								<h2>Player VS Computer (PVC)</h2>

								<img style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; width: 232px; height: 158px; border-radius: 5px; clear: both; float: right;" src="/content/CMD-Tic-Tac-Toe/pvc2.png">
								<img style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px; width: 552px; height: 206px; border-radius: 5px; clear: both; float: right;" src="/content/CMD-Tic-Tac-Toe/pvcgame.png">
								
								<p>
									The PVC part of the program is made up from 14 screens in total, including the levels, of which are 9. But keep in mind that the difficulty of the 
									computer you play against inside those levels does not increase, since it's just a number randomizer so it's easy to win if you have at least 7 
									braincells (if you only have 6 or less...um...too bad).
								</p>

								<p>
									When you end a game inside of a level there will be "stars" shown. The amount of them depends on how many moves it took the player to win (if 
									you lost you getz no start lol). There are 3 starts max you can get on any level. If you won the game in 3 moves you get all 3 stars, if you won 
									in 4 you get 2 and if you won in 5 moves you only get one. If it somehow took you more than 5 moves to win, you may just be really dumb (no stars 
									for you!!). In the code of the game, each rank of a star is connected to a level individually, but now as I'm writing this I'm realising that it 
									would probably just be best to use a 2-dimensional array. Well too bad.
								</p>

								<p>
									Now, let's talk about the actual gameplay. On the bottom left side you have a small guide on the positions in the grid. On top of it, in the top 
									left corner, you have the number of the level you are currently playing and how many stars you have got in it. You input your choice in the bottom 
									middle part of the screen. Now that may look a bit strange to somebody who has used the Windows CLI to do anything. The reason for that being - you 
									can't have text after a std::cin argument. 
								</p>
									
								<p>
									Well i got around that by first outputting all of the UI and then setting the position of the CLI cursor 
									with SetConsoleCursorPosition(hConsole, coordinates). There's just one problem... if i used std::cin it would offset the bottom right line after it 
									if the player typed in anything. And that's why I'm not using it, but rather getch(). Getch() is a Windows CLI function that records the pressed keys. 
									And that is it for Player VS Computer. Moving on.
								</p>

								<h2>Player VS Player (PVP)</h2>

								<p>
									The PVP part is bascially the same as the PVC part. In the top left corner it is displayed who is playing and who's turn it is. In the future, I might 
									add the possibility to use any character as your character in the game, but for now I'd say it's pretty much done. And... that's all for my Tic Tac Toe 
									app. Hope you had a good read.

									It's basically an MP3 player themed around the music made by The Caretaker. I still have a lot of work to do so, it wont be released anytime soon
